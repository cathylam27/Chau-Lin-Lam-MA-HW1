        <p>I’m very interesting about graphic design, so I want to become a designer in a famous international company in Canada. I want (and I need) to learn more about international design styles and more other media design skills because it will help me to find about the job.</p>

            <p>In fact, I can learn a lot of interactive media design skills on the program, so I believe that it can help me to find a designer job successfully. Finally, I want to live and work in Canada for a long time. Ahahaha… I hope I can have my dream house in there too.</p>
